# My GPT Prompts
Hello, welcome to my Github Repo. In this repo, I have converted all of my prompts into Text Files. You are free to reuse these prompts, edit them, and do whatever you want with them. Credit is not required, but is appreciated.

# Where they come from
Some of these prompts I got the idea from others, however, most of which are my own original ideas.

# How do I use them?
To use these prompts, simply visit [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com) and paste it into ChatGPT's input. My prompts shouldn't need any tinkering after that.

# I would like to improve your prompts!
That is very generous of you, if you would like to help improve my prompts, please fork the repo, and edit the changes, once completed, simply submit a pull request. I will review said pull requests at the earliest convience.

# Would you like to support me?

All help is very appreciated.
